Some essential terminology for causal mapping.






| Term               | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Causal claim       | A section of text where someone or something says or claims that one thing (a cause) influences or influenced another (an effect). There need be no suggestion that the cause is the only cause of the effect, or totally determines it.                                                                                             |
| Causal link        | A causal link is the representation of a causal claim within a causal mapping system or database. Each link consists of a cause, an effect, a quote or other evidence to back up the claim, and a source, for example an interview transcript.                                                                                       |
| Coding             | The process of capturing a causal claim in a text as a causal link in a database or map.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Bundle             | Often there will be many links with the same causes and effects. We call this set of links a *bundle* of links. Usually these links are mentioned by multiple  sources. In a causal map, we usually display all the links in a bundle as one arrow. A thicker line or a label can be used to show the number of links in the bundle. |
| Source             | Sources are where your causal claims come from: respondents you have interviewed or documents you have collected. Sources are usually given an ID like, say, `Source_001`.                                                                                                                                                           |
| Cause              | A causal factor at the beginning of a link, that affects another factor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Influence factor   | See *cause*. Sometimes we prefer "Influence factor" over "Cause" to make it clear that we may be talking only about a partial contribution to an effect, not complete determination.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Effect             | A causal factor at the end of a link, that has been influenced by another factor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Consequence factor | See Effect. Sometimes we prefer "Consequence factor" over "Effect" to make it clear that we may be talking only about a partial contribution to an effect, not complete determination.                                                                                                                                               |
| Factor             | A cause or an effect; something that can influence or be influenced by other factors. We use the word both for the text label within the causal mapping representation as well as for the thing in the world to which it refers.                                                                                                     |
| Codebook           | A list of factor labels that can be used when coding causal links and/or other instructions for coding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Causal map         | A set of causal links between a set of factors, usually interconnected, such that a link from X to Y means that someone says or claims that X influences or influenced Y. We can think of a causal map as a visual representation or more abstractly just as a table or database of links which can be visualised.                   |
| Self-loop          | A causal link from one factor to itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Column             | Data associated with a link or a source: some columns are essential, e.g. a link must have a cause and an effect, and some are optional.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Field              | See *column*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

## Additional terminology

| Term                | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Combining opposites | When we combine any pairs of factors which are opposites. This means merging two factors which are identical apart from one starts with a ‘~’, to indicate a negative. On print view the link will show green and pink to indicate that both the positive and negative of the factor is true.  |
| Contrary factor     | With a pair of opposite factors like `Progress` and `~Progress`, we call `Progress` the *ordinary* factor and we call `~Progress` the *contrary* factor. (We prefer this terminology to, say, “negative factor” as it has fewer unwanted connotations: contrary factors don’t have to be bad.) |
| Hashtags            | A recurring subject found within the factor labels i.e. farming or health. Often we use symbols like # to make sure that the hashtags are uniquely searchable.                                                                                                                                 |
| Hierarchical coding | Nested factors (see below) put factor labels in a hierarchy from more general to specific. [See more here.](https://guide.causalmap.app/glossary#simplifying)                                                                                                                                  |
| Hybrid format       | (Mostly used in QuIP/BSDR coding.) When uploading data into Causal Map, a data table in hybrid format has some rows which are statements and some which are metadata.                                                                                                                          |
| Magnetic labels     | A feature in the app used for re-labeling and organizing factors. Magnetic labels attract existing labels of similar meaning, essentially relabeling these old labels with the new magnetic label. What we call soft-coding.                                                                   |
| Mapfile, File       | When working in Causal Map, all your original data (the statements, source and question data) as well as the coding you have done (factors and links) are stored together in one file which we call a mapfile, or just file.                                                                   |
| Memos               | You can make short notes or memos on each statement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Nested factors      | Factor labels can be nested meaning there are higher level factors i.e New intervention; midwife training; hand washing instructions.                                                                                                                                                          |
| View aka shortlink  | A weblink (URL) to a causal map which has been shortened, usually to make sharing it easier. You can easily make shortlinks using the library.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Statement           | Refers to each individual piece of text to be coded in Causal Map, usually this is a sentence, a paragraph or a few paragraphs. Each statement has an ID like 1, 2, 3 etc.                                                                                                                     |
| Sigs                | Sigs = significance. Significance level for showing a row is 0.1 and tables with less than 8 items are suppressed. Significance symbols: .=0.1, \*=0.05, \*\*=0.01, \*\*\*=0.001                                                                                                               |
