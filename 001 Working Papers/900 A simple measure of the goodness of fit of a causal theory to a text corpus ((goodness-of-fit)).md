### Abstract

> Suppose an evaluation team has a corpus of interviews and progress reports, plus (at least) two candidate theories of change (ToCs): an original one and a revised one. A practical question is: **which ToC better fits the narrative evidence**?

> With almost-automated causal coding as described in [@powellAIassistedCausalMapping2025a; @powellWorkflowCollectingUnderstanding2025], we can turn that into a simple set of *coverage-style* diagnostics: how much of the coded causal evidence can be expressed in the vocabulary of each ToC.

See also: [[000 Working Papers ((working-papers))]]; [[005 Minimalist coding for causal mapping ((minimalist))]]; [[900 Magnetisation ((magnetisation))]].

**Intended audience:** evaluators and applied researchers comparing candidate ToCs (or other causal frameworks) against narrative evidence, who want a transparent “fit” diagnostic that does not pretend to be causal inference.

**Unique contribution (what this paper adds):**

- A definition of **coverage over causal links** (not just themes): link / citation / source coverage variants.
- A simple protocol for comparing candidate ToC vocabularies using hard recode or [[900 Magnetisation ((magnetisation))]] (soft recode).
- A careful positioning of “coverage” relative to mainstream QDA usage (saturation/counting as support for judgement, not a mechanical rule).

### 1. The core idea: “coverage” of evidence by a codebook

In ordinary QDA (thematic coding), researchers often look at how widely a codebook or set of themes is instantiated across a dataset: which codes appear, how frequently, and whether adding more data still yields new codes (saturation). Counting is not the whole of qualitative analysis, but it is a common, explicitly discussed support for judgement and transparency [@saldanaCodingManualQualitative2015]. Critiques of turning saturation into a mechanical rule-of-thumb are also well known [@braunSaturateNotSaturate2019].

Our twist is: because we are coding **causal links** (not just themes), we can define coverage over *causal evidence* rather than over text volume.

### 2. Minimal definitions

- A **coded link** is a row of the form `(Source_ID, Quote, Cause_Label, Effect_Label, ...)`.
- A **ToC codebook** is a vocabulary (list) of ToC factor labels you want to recognise in the corpus.
- A **mapping** from raw labels to ToC labels can be done either:
  - strictly (exact match / “hard recode”), or
  - softly via magnetisation (semantic similarity; “soft recode”) — see [[900 Magnetisation ((magnetisation))]].

### 3. Coverage measures you can compute

Assume we have a baseline set of coded links `L` (from open coding), and a ToC codebook `C` (as magnets / targets).

#### 3.1 Link coverage (our main measure)

**Link coverage** = proportion of coded links whose endpoints can be expressed in the ToC vocabulary.

Two variants (pick one and state it explicitly):

- **Both-ends coverage**: count a link as “covered” only if *both* cause and effect are mapped to some ToC label.
- **At-least-one-end coverage**: count a link as “covered” if either endpoint maps (useful when ToC vocabulary is intentionally partial).

#### 3.2 Citation coverage (weighted link coverage)

If your dataset has multiple citations per bundle (or you have `Citation_Count`), compute coverage over **citations**, not just distinct links:

- covered citations / total citations

This answers: “what proportion of the *evidence volume* is expressible in this ToC?”

#### 3.3 Source coverage (breadth)

**Source coverage** = number (or proportion) of sources for which at least \(k\) links are covered by the ToC vocabulary.

This answers: “does this ToC vocabulary work across many sources, or only a small subset?”

### 4. Protocol (how to use it)

For each candidate ToC:

1. Build a ToC codebook `C` (ideally keep candidate codebooks similar in size and specificity, otherwise you are partly measuring codebook granularity).
2. Map raw labels to `C` (hard recode or soft recode).
3. Compute:
   - link coverage (both-ends and/or one-end),
   - citation coverage (if available),
   - source coverage (with an explicit \(k\)).
4. Inspect the **leftovers** (uncovered labels/links): what important evidence is the ToC not even able to name?

### 5. How this relates to “coverage” in mainstream qualitative methods

The word “coverage” is used in a few nearby ways in qualitative methodology:

- **Code (or theme) saturation**: whether new data still yields new codes/themes; the distinction between “code saturation” and “meaning saturation” is often emphasised (e.g. Hennink et al. on code vs meaning saturation; and the broader critique that saturation is not a universal stopping rule in all qualitative paradigms) [@braunSaturateNotSaturate2019].  
  - (For orientation, see: Hennink, Kaiser & Marconi (2017) “Code Saturation Versus Meaning Saturation”, *Qualitative Health Research*, DOI: `10.1177/1049732316665344`; Guest, Bunce & Johnson (2006) “How Many Interviews Are Enough?”, *Field Methods*, DOI: `10.1177/1525822X05279903`.)
- **Counting for transparency**: many QDA approaches use counts (how often codes occur; how widely they occur across cases) as a support for analytic claims, without equating frequency with importance [@saldanaCodingManualQualitative2015].

What we are doing here is closer to: **how much of the coded evidence can be expressed in the language of a candidate theory**, which is a “fit” diagnostic rather than a claim about truth.

### 6. Caveats

- Coverage is sensitive to **granularity**: broader ToC labels will (almost by definition) cover more.
- High coverage does not imply causal truth; it only implies that the ToC vocabulary is a good *naming scheme* for a large share of the corpus.
- Low coverage can mean either “ToC is missing key mechanisms” or “coding/mapping is too strict” — inspect leftovers before concluding.
