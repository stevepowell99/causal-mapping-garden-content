<div class="user-guide-callout">
<strong>🗂️ What you can do here:</strong> Choose which Project (project) you want to work on. Use the File menu for quick actions like creating new Projects, uploading documents, or sharing your work with others.
</div>

- A small locked indicator at the top-right of `#project-selector-header` shows only when a project is read-only.
- An archived icon appears only when the project is archived. Archived projects are automatically read-only and only visible to owners, collaborators, and admins (not visible to the public even if marked public).
- **New Project or Upload Sources** <i class="fas fa-plus"></i>: Opens a modal to create a new project or add sources to the current project. Choose files and/or **Or paste text** (plain text becomes a source file named `pasted-text.txt`), then Continue. A **Show Advanced** switch (default off) skips the [Confirm Upload](../upload-documents/) screen and uses defaults (keep filenames as IDs, no custom columns, no split). When on, the Confirm Upload modal appears for adjusting filenames, adding custom columns, or splitting sources (including delimiter split for pasted text).


### File menu {#file-menu}
Quick access to common actions:

#### **Manage the Current Project**{#manage-current-project}
- **Edit** <i class="fas fa-pencil-alt"></i>: Modify settings and sharing
- **Upload sources** <i class="fas fa-plus"></i>: Add documents (PDF, DOCX, RTF, TXT, MD) or XLSX with a `statements` tab to the current Project
- **Clone** <i class="far fa-clone"></i>: Create a complete copy of the Project under a new name
- **Merge** <i class="fas fa-code-merge"></i>: Copy sources and links from selected projects into this one
- **Clone filtered** <i class="far fa-clone"></i>: Create a copy of the current Project but only containing the sources and links as currently filtered
- **Archive** <i class="fas fa-archive"></i>: Hide from main list
- **Delete all links** <i class="fas fa-trash"></i>: Remove every causal link in this Project (sources remain)
- **Download** <i class="fas fa-download"></i>: Export as XLSX
- **Versions** <i class="fas fa-history"></i>: Restore and create backups of this Project
- **Update sources (Excel)** <i class="fas fa-file-excel"></i>: Upload an XLSX to update sources in-place ("round-tripping").
  - **Tabs**: Must contain a `sources` tab (lowercase). Other tabs are ignored.
  - **Required** (**case-insensitive headers**): Must include an `id` column. IDs must exist in the current project.
  - **Columns**: You can include only the columns you want to change. Any missing columns are left unchanged.
  - **Updates**: `title`, `filename`, `content` (if those columns exist). Any other columns are merged into `metadata.custom_columns`.
- **Manage projects** <i class="fas fa-folder-open"></i>: Opens the [Projects](../projects-panel/) tab as a shortcut

#### **Create new project**{#manage-projects}
- **Quick upload** <i class="fas fa-plus"></i>: Create a new project or add sources to the current project (same as the green + button in the Files bar)
- **New Project** <i class="fas fa-plus"></i>: Create an empty Project which you can then import sources into
- **Import XLSX** <i class="fas fa-file-excel"></i>: Import a complete new Project from Excel ("round-tripping").
  - **Tabs**: If the XLSX has 1 tab, it is treated as the sources tab (whatever its name). If it has multiple tabs, it must contain `sources` (lowercase); `links` (lowercase) is optional.
  - **Long source text**: If the XLSX contains a `source_content_chunks` tab (exported by this app when source content exceeds spreadsheet per-cell limits), imports will rehydrate `sources.content` from it.
  - **Format note**: CausalMap can import many document/file formats elsewhere in the app, but a BathSDR-style QuIP Excel workbook is not supported by this XLSX importer.
  - **`sources` columns** (**case-insensitive headers**): source id comes from `id` (preferred) or `source_id`; source text comes from `content` (preferred) or `text`. Any other (non-empty) columns are imported as custom columns (into `metadata.custom_columns`).
  - **`links` columns (optional)**: uses `cause`, `effect`, `sentiment`, `tags`, `source_id`, `selected_text` (and remaps `source_id` based on the old ids from the sources sheet).
    - Any other non-empty `links` columns are imported into `links.metadata.custom_columns`.
    - For round-trip consistency, incoming `custom_<name>` headers are normalized to `<name>` before writing `links.metadata.custom_columns`.
- **Import cm3** <i class="fas fa-upload"></i>: Import a complete new Project downloaded from CausalMap3.
  - **Tabs**: Requires `links` and `statements` (lowercase). Optional: `sources`, `questions`.
  - **`statements` columns** (**case-insensitive headers**): requires `source_id` and `text` (optional `statement_id`/`id`, optional `question_id`).
  - **`links` columns used**: `from_label`, `to_label`, `quote`, `hashtags`, `sentiment`, `statement_id` (used to map links to sources via the statements sheet).




### Project Dropdown {#project-selector-dropdown}
- 👉🏼 **Project** (dropdown): lists all the projects you have created or been invited to; selecting one opens it.
- 👉🏼 **On change**: the rest of the app resets to defaults (sources selection + analysis filters pipeline).

- On startup, the app auto-selects the most recent **viewable** project (owned by you, shared with you, or public). 
- Admins can see all projects in the Projects table, but the dropdown never auto-selects or loads a non-viewable project; admins may open the Edit Project modal for non-viewable projects from the table only.


### Project Details button {#project-details}

- A small pencil button sits to the right of the [Project Dropdown](../project-selector-dropdown/).
- Clicking it opens the Project Details screen, the same as you get by clicking the first item in the [File menu](../file-menu/)<!--(alias of `#share-project-btn`)-->, which we describe next:



<!---


**Excel Import/Export ("round-tripping"):**
- Download button exports selected Project as Excel Project with separate tabs for sources and links
- Import button allows uploading Excel Projects to create new Projects
- Upload uses same format as download for consistency
- **Smart ID processing**: 
  - ID: Uses `id` column if available, otherwise falls back to `source_id` column
  - If provided IDs are 8 characters or less, uses them directly (ensuring uniqueness)
  - If provided IDs are longer than 8 characters, applies smart trimming algorithm that removes common prefixes and creates optimal 8-character IDs
  - Falls back to title-based generation if no ID column is provided
- **Content mapping**: Uses `content` column if available, otherwise falls back to `text` column
- Additional columns are imported as custom metadata

**cm3 Format Import:**
- Specialized import for cm3 Excel Projects using "links" and "statements" tabs
- Column mapping: from_label→cause, to_label→effect, quote→selected_text
- Hashtags converted to comma-separated tags
- Sentiment values (defaults to 0 if missing)
- Statement_id joins to statements tab for source_id lookup
- Auto-generated timestamps for created_at field
- Source content created by concatenating text from each source_id and inserting the statement_id (and question_id if present):

statement_id: xyz
question_id: foobar
text text text

etc


also, if there is a tab in the excel sheet called questions and it has columns for question_id and question_text, also join to that data and add question_text: foobar as well

statement_id: xyz
question_id: foobar
question_text: blah blah
text text text

etc

**cm3 Sources handling:**
- When uploading cm3 xlsx, import additional columns in sources tab as custom columns (JSON format)
- Assumes xlsx has sources tab, otherwise skip
- When concatenating statements with same source_id, source_id corresponds to sources tab for additional metadata

### Project Details screen {#edit-project-modal}
Manage every aspect of the current project. You can reach this management pane by clicking Edit from the [File menu](../file-menu/). Manage other projects by clicking the edit button in the corresponding row of the [Projects Panel](../projects-panel/).

<div class="user-guide-callout">
<strong>📄 What you can do here:</strong>

- <strong>Open it</strong>: File → Edit, or the edit icon in the Projects table.
- <strong>When it appears</strong>: Also opens on project load/change unless you turn it off for this project.
- <strong>Save vs instant changes</strong>:
  - Use the <em>Save</em> button to apply changes to <strong>Name</strong>, <strong>Tags</strong>, and <strong>Description</strong>.
  - <strong>Archived</strong>, <strong>Locked</strong>, <strong>Public</strong>, and <strong>Collaborators</strong> update instantly.
</div>

#### Details
- <strong>Name</strong>: Rename the project. Click <em>Rename</em> to save.
- <strong>Tags</strong>: Comma‑separated tags for quick grouping/searching.
- <strong>Description</strong>: Free‑text notes about the project.
- <strong>Edit codebook</strong>: Toggle to reveal a text area where you can list factor labels (one per line). These are added to the cause/effect dropdowns in the link editor; existing options are kept.
- <strong>AI Processing Region</strong>: Choose where AI processing occurs for GDPR/data residency compliance:
  - **EU (Belgium - europe-west1)** - Default. Recommended for EU data residency requirements.
  - **UK (London - europe-west2)** - UK has GDPR adequacy decision, suitable for EU/UK compliance.
  - **US (Virginia - us-east5)** - US East region.
  - Setting is saved per-project and auto-saves on change (with confirmation warning).
  - All subsequent AI coding for this project uses the selected region.
- <strong>Archived</strong>: Hide the project from the main list and make it read-only. Archived projects are only visible to owners, collaborators, and admins (hidden from public view even if marked public). Applied immediately. Unarchiving restores normal visibility and editability.
- <strong>Info line</strong>: Created / Modified / Owner, plus counts for links/sources/words, and quick actions:
  - <em>Versions</em>: Open the versions manager.
  - <em>Delete embeddings</em>: Remove factor embeddings for this project (advanced).
- <strong>Show on open</strong>: Toggle "Show this screen when opening this project" at the top to auto‑open or suppress this screen for this project.

<!-- Technical: AI region setting is stored in projects.metadata.ai_region as 'eu'/'uk'/'us' and mapped to Vertex AI regions ('europe-west1'/'europe-west2'/'us-east5') by AIManager._getVertexRegion(). Default is 'eu'. The setting is passed as vertex_region parameter to the vertex-ai edge function. Data retention: Google's zero data retention policy applies; in-memory caching up to 24 hours (can be disabled); prompt logging for abuse monitoring can be disabled with invoiced billing account. All compliant with GDPR when EU/UK regions selected. See https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/multimodal-faqs -->

#### Sharing
- <strong>Locked</strong>: Make the project read‑only. Editing is disabled until unlocked. Applied immediately.
- <strong>Public</strong>: Allow all signed‑in users to view the project (read‑only). Applied immediately.
- <strong>Collaborators</strong>: See current collaborators, add by email, and choose permission:
  - <em>Viewer</em>: Read‑only
  - <em>Editor</em>: Read & write

#### Bookmarks
- If available, view saved “bookmarked” views of your data and open the Bookmark Manager.

<!---
#### Footer
- <strong>Load Project</strong>: Loads the project into the app workspace.

The Load Project button loads the Project into the dropdown and triggers the Project loading process.

This screen also shows when a project loads or is changed, except:
- for new users (the help drawer is still being opened to welcome them),
- if you have already clicked "don't show" for this project. 



<!---

- When it opens:
  - Automatically on project load/change if not suppressed and no other modal/help welcome is active.
